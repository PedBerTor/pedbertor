Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pedro Bernaldez, a dedicated and passionate Software Engineer with over three years of experience in building software. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to lead and manage teams in an international environment, fostering a collaborative atmosphere that drives innovation and excellence.

In addition to my professional work, I'm actively involved in personal projects, which allow me to explore different technologies and paradigms. Some of them are publicly available on my GitHub profile. I encourage you to take a look at them.

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, discussions about technology, or just to connect!
